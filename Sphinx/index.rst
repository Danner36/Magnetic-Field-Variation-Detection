Magnetic Field Variation Detection (MFVD)
=========================================

Summary
-------

The problem that this project set out to solve or shed light on, is if the magnetic sphere generated 
by a current-carrying power line can be detected at its original frequency of 60Hz at any distance from 
said wire. To accomplish this task, a test enviroment was created that would suspend the wire and sensor 
above the ground to avoid any distortion caused by the the surrounding area, while also providing a steady 
platform to repeatably capture data from a magnetometer at varying distances from the suspended wire. 

Once completed, the initial data showed fair results. With 7 Amperes (A) being pulled through a wire, the 
field being produced was detected up to just under 0.1 meters (3.93in) away. At 13.5A, the wire generated a field 
that was detectable up to 0.15m (5.90in). Finally at 19.5A, the field being generated by the wire could be detected 
to a distance of 0.2m (7.87in) away. This data was all collected while the magnetometer and wire were in stationary 
positions. The data indicates that it is possible to distinguish a 60Hz signal from the varying background noise caused 
by other magnetic objects and or the Earth's geomagnetic field.
