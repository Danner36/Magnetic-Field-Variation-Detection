Hardware
========

This section does into detail about what type of hardware was used during 
the project and what purpose it served.

Micro Controller
----------------

The micro controller used for the entirety of this project was Espressif's ESP32 Developement
Board. This board was chosen due its competitive cost, large onboard memory, and dual core 
functionality. The dual core system onboard the ESP32 was utilized in a way that the first core
was responsible for transmission/recovery of data via the serial port and the second core was 
used to communicate to the HMC5883L (described below), retrieve its data, and format it correctly
before passing it back to the Jupyter for display.
